# RETabBinder TBC

### [Download Here](https://github.com/XiconQoo/RETabBinder/releases/download/v1.6.1-TBC/RETabBinder_v1.6.1-TBC.zip)

This is a backport from [RETabBinder v1.6.1](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/retabbinder/files/3115203).

All credits go to [AcidWeb](https://www.curseforge.com/members/acidweb/projects) having continued the original Addon TabBinder from Veev.

## What it does

RETabBinder will automatically change your TAB key binding to only target enemy players when in PvP zones, and to target all enemies when not.
